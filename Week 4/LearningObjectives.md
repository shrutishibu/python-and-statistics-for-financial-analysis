# Linear Regrssion models for Financial Analysis
In this module, we will explore the most often used prediction method - linear regression. From learning the association of random variables to simple and multiple linear regression model, we finally come to the most interesting part of this course: we will build a model using multiple indices from the global markets and predict the price change of an ETF of S&P500. In addition to building a stock trading model, it is also great fun to test the performance of your own models, which I will also show you how to evaluate them!

Learning Objectives
- Classify the differences of using covariance and correlation in measuring the association of two random variables
- Interpret the association of combination of 2 variables by visualization using python
- Give examples of responses and predictors in a simple linear regression model
- Illustrate the examples of responses and predictors from financial perspective
- Explain the nature of simple linear regression model is to find the best fit line to the mean equation
- Use python code in looking for the best fit line in building a simple linear regression model
- Analyze the signififace, impact and performance of a simple linear regression model by reviewing the summary using python
- Discuss how to diagnotic the validity of the simple linear regression model by checking against the 4 assumptions of linear regression model
- Create a signal based trading strategy base on linear regression model
- Interpret the major purpose of splitting the stock data into train set and test set in financial analysis
- Evaluate the performance of a stock trading model using 2 major financial indicators
